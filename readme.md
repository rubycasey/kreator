# KREATOR: THE POST-INSTALL SCRIPT
This script installs and configures your GNU/Linux based OS to Ruby's liking.
```NOTE: as of v0.2.0 the script only supports the XBPS package manager. For Arch support, try v0.1.2.```

## What it does
It basically just installs common packages I end up installing on every system I setup, does some configuring, and usually installs theme files I commonly use. You can pick and choose components by following the prompts, for example if you *only* want to install cli tools, you can skip the gui tools installation, or the theme installation.

## How to use
Make it executable:

```chmod +x kreator.sh```

then, run the program and follow the prompts.

```./kreator.sh```

**NOTE:** The program only has support for pacman based systems at the moment.

## Where does the name come from?
I was literally in a discord call with a friend and said "give me a name for a program" and he said "creator but with a k" so that's where we are lol.
